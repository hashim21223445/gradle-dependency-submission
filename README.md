> [!IMPORTANT]  
> With the introduction of support for the `Dependency Submission API` into the official [Gradle Build Action](https://github.com/gradle/gradle-build-action?tab=readme-ov-file#github-dependency-graph-support) this project is officially deprecated. 
> Please consider using the [Gradle Build Action](https://github.com/gradle/gradle-build-action?tab=readme-ov-file#github-dependency-graph-support) for new projects.

### What's included üöÄ

- Supports any Gradle project
  - Uses the Gradle `dependencies` task
- Highly flexible configuration
- Submits all maven dependencies via the Dependency Submission API

> **Note**: This action executes the `dependencies` task of a given Gradle project, and will submit the dependency tree via the [Dependency Submission API](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/using-the-dependency-submission-api).

> **Note**: At this time `Gradle 7.5` or newer is required as it offers a new task to retrieve individual properties. (Used to retrieve build file path, and project name)

## Setup

### Configure the workflow

```yml
name: build
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - develop # run the action on your projects default branch

jobs:
  build:
    name: Dependencies
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions: # The Dependency Submission API requires write permission
      contents: write
    steps:
      - name: 'Checkout Repository'
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Run snapshot action
        uses: mikepenz/gradle-dependency-submission@{latest}
        with:
          gradle-project-path: "gradle-example"
          gradle-build-module: ":app"
```

<details><summary><b>Root Module Config</b></summary>
<p>

The following example showcases a gradle module in the root, without a module name, and no sub-folder.

```yml
- name: Root Gradle Dependency Submission
  uses: mikepenz/gradle-dependency-submission@{latest}
  with:
    use-gradlew: false
    gradle-build-module: |-
      :
    gradle-build-configuration: |-
      compileClasspath
```

</p>
</details>

<details><summary><b>Multi Module Config</b></summary>
<p>

```yml
- name: Gradle Dependency Submission
  uses: mikepenz/gradle-dependency-submission@{latest}
  with:
    gradle-project-path: |-
      gradle-example
    gradle-build-module: |-
      :app
      :simple-app
    gradle-build-configuration: |-
      debugCompileClasspath
```

</p>
</details>

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Currently the action has to be run on the default branch. Running it as part of a PR won't update the [Dependency graph](https://github.com/mikepenz/gradle-dependency-submission/network/dependencies) of your projects [Insights](https://github.com/mikepenz/gradle-dependency-submission/pulse) - This seems to be a GitHub requirement.

### Inputs

| **Input**      | **Description**                                                                                                                                                       |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `use-gradlew`    | Defines if `./gradlew` or `gradle` cli will be used to retrieve the dependencies. Defaults to 'true' e.g. `./gradlew`.|
| `gradle-project-path`    | Defines the path to the gradle project. Defaults to ''. |
| `gradle-build-module`    | Defines the module to retrieve the dependencies for. This is often `:app`. Defaults to ':'.  |
| `gradle-build-configuration`    | Optional configuration filter, for which the dependencies are resolved. As example: Android projects - `debugCompileClasspath`, plain java projects - `compileClasspath`. |
| `gradle-build-configuration-mapping`    | Optional configuration to allow per module build configuration mapping. Provide one mapping per line in the format like: `:module\|compileClasspath` |
| `gradle-dependency-path`    | Defines the path to the gradle dependency file, relative to the `gradle-project-path`. If not provided, automatically resolved via gradle and the `module` config. |
| `sub-module-mode`  | Defines how the action handles sub projects/modules. Possible options `IGNORE`, `COMBINED`, `INDIVIDUAL`, `INDIVIDUAL_DEEP`. Default: `IGNORE`. |
| `include-build-environment`  | Optional mode to enable the submission of the `buildEnvironment` as individual Manifest via the dependency submission API. Default: `false`. |
| `fail-on-error`   | Optional setting to enable an action failure in case any of the dependencies can not be parsed. Default: `false`. |
| `correlator`  | 'Optional correlator string to submit to GitHub to identify the dependency submission.  Defaults to generating based on gradle-build-module and gradle-build-configuration.' |
| `legacy-support`  | 'Disabled by default. Optional setting to enable support for gradle versions below 7.5. Warning: When enabled, the action will retrieve all properties and retrieve the property value of interest. During the parsing this may include other properties. Prefer to upgrade to gradle 7.5 or newer instead!' |

| **sub-module-mode**      |    **Description**           |
| ----- | ---- |
| `IGNORE`      | Ignores sub projects/modules and skips over their dependencies. Only the core module is being imported. |
| `COMBINED`    | Combines and flattens the sub dependencies, and attaches them to the root of the parent module. |
| `INDIVIDUAL`  | Handles every single module as its own `Manifest` in the dependency submission API. Uses the gradle API to retrieve the module paths, and imports them individually. |
| `INDIVIDUAL_DEEP`  | Handles every single module as its own `Manifest` in the dependency submission API. Will call the `dependencies` task for every single sub project/module to gather the full tree. Uses the gradle API to retrieve the module paths, and imports them individually. |
